My online community Python Discord
 ============
 The online community I am in is the official Python community of Discord.   The online Python Discord can see various levels of Python-related people and multiple sources. However, suppose you don't clarify why you should learn Python yourself and what direction you're studying. In that case, you may find it challenging to adapt to the vast amount of sections and information you enter this community. Therefore, even beginners can be more useful if they start with projects they want to do or with clear goals.

## The Community's Amazing First Impression and Various Regulations
____
<br>


>What's surprising about this community is that, unlike the NYC python community or small community, each of the necessary sections is separated in detail and reasonably. Also, the community operates under solid regulations. For example, if you help with a project on an ongoing test, it is against the community's policy.

## What if you want to be a constant user of the community?
----

>To make good use of this community, it is essential to set your standards that can be heard in general. Above all, the district has various regulations, so I recommend you read them carefully. In particular, for students who will participate in the community through classes, only a few of these vast channels can be used intensively if you clearly think about a field or topics you are interested in. For example, since I am targeting UX/UI designers, I have seen the User interface, Web development channels the most.

## How to get help from the community
----

>I will explain how to get help from the community, which is valuable information in this community. Send a question to one of the three possible help channels in the green check box section. The bot will be asked questions and move your channel to "Occupied." Therefore, you can get help from the Help channel under the name of fruits and vegetables. You should know that you can request a new channel every 15 minutes, you don't use the channel, and after 30 minutes, the channel automatically closes. You can also end the Help section manually using !close.

## Guideline about Asking Good questions
-----

>Before asking for help, I hope that if I had reviewed the questionnaire provided by the official Python, I would have shown sufficient details and minimal code examples better. It's essential to prepare good questions to answer. Examine whether Google can solve the problem you're trying to ask. 

## My community experience
---
>When asked personally on the User interface channel about implementing a list of articles for a website project, a user used a repeating statement and told the site of StackOverflow using os. listdir(). Also, I was personally interested in UX/UI, so I could see how to program the interface on the user interface channel. Besides, through various events on Python, I can gain interest and recent trends through various news. 


## Summary
---
Using this community, what I personally considered most important as a student was getting regulation and help from the Python community. And if you want to stay in this community for a long time as a Python expert, it is crucial to ensure your category while simultaneously working on personal projects. Although the official Python community is so vast that it is possible to get lost, it has the great advantage of knowing the activities and latest trends of many active users. If you are interested in Python, please pay attention to this online community.
