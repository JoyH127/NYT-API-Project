 Gun Violence 
 ============
 My project is to check how many gun violences in america through checking daily news reports and articles related to 'gun' keyword. My code will pass news subreddits and get titles from the subreddit data. Therefore, the result of my code will form cvs file to list tile, the total number of articles and the number of word 'gun' each article. 

<br>

## Code Example 
____
<br>

### ***CVS chart Function***
<br>

>gunresult.csv file will be written and make lists with titles, word count, and Gun Count in a row. For loop will iterate from 0 to the end of the titles, so it can check whether each title has a gun in the title list. If the title has the word 'gun,' the code will add the count number. If not, it will show up zero.
